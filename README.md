# WGU Mobile Application

Created By: **Gabriel Jones**

**WGU Mobile Application** was created as part of the C196 Mobile Application Development course curriculum. It allows users to add assessments, courses, and terms to their study plans and associate them with each other. Assessments can be Objective or Performance-based and include a title, start date, and an optional associated course. Users can also enable push notifications for assessment start and end dates.

Each course has a title, start, and end date, progress options, instructor name, phone, and email. It can be optionally associated with a term, and users can set push notifications for course start and end dates. Additionally, the app offers the option to share course notes via SMS.

For terms, users can input a title, start, and end date, and view a list of associated courses. They also have the choice to enable push notifications for term start and end dates.

Terms and Courses cannot be deleted when they have an associated Course or Assessment

This application was created using Java, Android Studio, and a ROOM Database.
